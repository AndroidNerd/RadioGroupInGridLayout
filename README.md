# RadioGroupInGridLayout
Cause in the present,we can't make an easy way to implements multi lines and multi columns RadioGroup,so i deside to make one.

you can use it like traditional RadioGroup but also can act like a Gridlayout.

For example , you can specify it as 3 columns ,so it will make 3 columns in a line,and then another.

Hope it can help you ~thx~
